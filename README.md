# Voalte Ordering Portal

### Summary
An integrated ordering portal where customers can order Voalte accessories without having to wait on Sales or Operations personnel. The portal is integrated with SalesForce, NetSuite, and JIRA to fully automate the process of: creating a quote; recording the quote in all systems; emailing a pdf of the quote to the customer; and creating a Logistics Hardware ticket in JIRA when the customer returns to the portal and uploads a Purchase Order.
